## 🔭 Research Overview
I am an astrophysicist focused on modeling the **internal structure and thermal evolution of exoplanets**. My work bridges the gap between theoretical planetary science and modern data science by implementing **neural networks and machine learning** within Bayesian inference frameworks to characterize distant worlds.

Currently, I manage the **HADES GitLab** repository and contribute to high-impact discoveries using data from the JWST and ESO.
